# PageMaster

This [Roll20](http://roll20.net/) script for allows the GM to designate certain pages as "public" pages to which players can freely navigate on their own. By adding a short tag to the name of the page, you mark it as public. Players can use the `!page menu` command to get a list of available pages that are links that will send them to those pages. While not on the page with the Player Ribbon they will have a button at the bottom of this list that allows them to rejoin the game.

GMs can change the tag used for marking pages and choose whether or not to be notified when players change pages in the config menu, accessible by sending `!page config` in chat.
